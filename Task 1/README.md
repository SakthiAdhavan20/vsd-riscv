# Task 1 â€“ Tool Installation

The goal of Task 1 is to install all essential tools required for the VSD Internship 2025.

---

## 1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on VirtualBox

Ubuntu is the operating system weâ€™ll use throughout this internship. We install it using Oracle VirtualBox so it runs inside your existing computer, without replacing your original OS.

Oracle VirtualBox is a free and open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization. It allows us to create a virtual machine (VM) where we install Ubuntu 20.04 as a guest OS.

## 2. Install RISC-V GNU Toolchain

The RISC-V GNU toolchain is a set of open-source programming tools (compiler, assembler, linker, etc.) for developing software for RISC-V-based processors. This toolchain helps convert C/C++ programs into RISC-V assembly so it can run on a RISC-V simulator or core.

### ðŸ”§ Commands Used:

```bash
# Clone the official RISC-V GNU Toolchain repository
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain

# Install required dependencies for building the toolchain
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip \
libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf \
libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake \
libglib2.0-dev libslirp-dev

# Move into the toolchain folder
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain

# Configure the build to install toolchain binaries in $HOME/riscv
./configure --prefix=$HOME/riscv

# Build the toolchain using all available processor cores
make -j$(nproc)
```

âœ… After installation, you must add the toolchain to your system PATH so that commands like `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` work from anywhere:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/riscv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 3. Install GTKWave

GTKWave is a waveform viewer that lets you view signal transitions over time from simulation files (like `.vcd`). It is crucial for debugging digital designs and understanding signal behavior in Verilog simulations.

```bash
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

Once installed, you can open it with `gtkwave` in the terminal.

## 4. Install Yosys

Yosys is an open-source framework for RTL synthesis. It translates Verilog RTL code into a lower-level netlist format. Itâ€™s commonly used with open-source ASIC/FPGA flows.

```bash
sudo apt install yosys
```

You can verify it with:
```bash
yosys -V
```

## 5. Install Icarus Verilog

Icarus Verilog is a simulator that compiles Verilog source files into executable simulation models. Itâ€™s used for testing Verilog code and generating `.vcd` files for GTKWave.

```bash
sudo apt install iverilog
```

You can compile and run simulations using:
```bash
iverilog testbench.v design.v
./a.out
```

## 6. Install xdot

`xdot` is a tool to visualize `.dot` files (graph descriptions), especially useful when analyzing synthesized RTL netlists from Yosys.

```bash
sudo apt install xdot
```

You can use this to view RTL-level connections (wires, gates) in a graphical form.

## âœ… All tools successfully installed and verified.

You are now ready to start simulation, synthesis, and RISC-V development using these tools.
